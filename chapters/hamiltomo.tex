\chapter{Tomography of Hamiltonians (just take the time derivative)}
\label{ch:Hamiltomo}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:HTIntro}
The hamiltomo project. Using super-stable tomography, we can measure the unitary
description of a photonic device. If the unitary is generated by a time-constant
Hamiltonian (as in quantum walks) then successive measurements of \(\mat{U}\)
(at least 2) can be used to reconstruct the underlying Hamiltonian. Use the time
derivative method.
