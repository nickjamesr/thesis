\section{Quantum Interference}
\label{sec:HOM}
The phenomenon of quantum interference is central to linear optical quantum
computing. It was famously observed in photonics in the form of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip \cite{hom}, and plays a major role in the
Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) proposal for scalable quantum computing.

The HOM
dip is perhaps the clearest illustration of quantum interference and is
illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:SimpleHoM}. If two particles are incident on a
50:50 beamsplitter in different input modes (A and B), they may be found in
three possible configurations at the output modes (\aprime{} and \bprime{}). One
particle may be transmitted and the other reflected, leading to both particles
in the same mode (labelled (b) and (c) in figure~\ref{fig:SimpleHoM}).
Alternatively, both particles could be reflected or both transmitted, resulting
in one particle in each mode (labelled (a) in figure~\ref{fig:SimpleHoM}).

In the classical picture, where the particles are distinguishable, we sum the
probabilities for each of the possible paths, resulting in probability 0.5 for
outcome (a), and 0.25 for each of outcomes (b) and (c). In the quantum picture
this is not the case and we must sum amplitudes, with signs depending on the
exchange symmetry of the particles. For bosons (including photons), the two ways
of obtaining outcome (a) interfere destructively, and the state at the output is
an equal superposition of (b) and (c). On measurement, each of these outcomes is
observed with probability 0.5. In the case of fermions, the quantum interference
(Pauli exclusion) is constructive for outcome (a) and it is observed with unit
probability.

Mathematically, this behaviour can be neatly described by permanents and
determinants of matrices. The unitary transfer matrix describing the
beamsplitter is
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \]
To calculate the classical probability of outcome (a), we take the
\emph{permanent} of the absolute square of this matrix. For bosons, the
probability is the absolute square of the \emph{permanent} of the matrix; for
fermions we take the absolute square of the \emph{determinant}. Note that the
order of taking the permanent (determinant) and the absolute square differs
between quantum and classical, reflecting summing of amplitudes rather than
probabilities. This formulation is discussed for larger interferometers in
section~\ref{sec:BosonSampling} on \bosonsampling{}.

A more complicated manifestation of quantum interference is observed when
multiple particles pass through a continuously coupled walk. A detailed
discussion of photonic quantum walks can be found in~\cite{walks-peruzzo}
and~\cite{walks-jasmin}; here I have summarised the results in
figure~\ref{fig:HoMWalk}. I have simulated injecting particles (distinguishable,
bosonic and fermionic) into the central modes (7 and 8) of a
continuously-coupled walk. When only one particle (here, a photon) is injected
(in mode 7), the probability of a detection at each of the output modes is shown
in (a). The remaining graphs show the outcome when two particles are injected,
one in each of modes 7 and 8. The \(\left(x,y\right)\) position in the array
represents two output modes, and the intensity of the colour indicates the
probability of a coincident detection between those two modes.

(b,c,d) model bosons, distinguishable particles and fermions,
respectively. We see that (c) is just a Cartesian product of (a) with itself
with high probabilities in the all four `corners' of the plot. When the
particles
are bosons (b), there is an enhancement along the \(y=x\) line (marked in
black): the two particles tend to go the same way! This observation, which we
call `bosonic clouding' is studied in chapter~\ref{ch:QCV} as a way of verifying
quantum behaviour. Finally, the fermions (d) obey Pauli exclusion: there is
zero probability along the \(y=x\) line and suppression nearby. The quantum
interference enhances the probabilities in the other two corners.

  the case of distinguishable particles, (a) occurs with probability
  0.5 and (b) and (c) occur with probability 0.25. For bosons, the two ways of

  that (b) and (c) are forbidden and (a) is the only possible outcome.}

\section{Evolution of Quantum States}
\label{sec:Evolution}
A large part (arguably all) of quantum mechanics concerns
calculating the evolution of quantum systems. At any time, a system in a pure
state\footnote{Except when explicitly stated, I am describing photonic states as
pure.} can be completely described by
its wavefunction, \(\ket{\Psi}\) \cite{pbr}. In the non-relativistic
picture\footnote{I am restricting the discussion to non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, since it offers a valid description of the behaviour of photons,
perhaps surprisingly since they travel at the speed of light.} this
wavefunction evolves according to the Schr\"odinger equation, in terms of the
Hamiltonian, \(\op{H}\):
\begin{equation}
  \op{H} \ket{\Psi} = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}
In the case of a Hamiltonian that is constant in time, we can integrate this
equation to obtain a time-evolution operator (sometimes referred to as a
propagator):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expiht}
  \op{U} \of{t} = e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar} \op{H} t}
\end{equation}
This operator relates a known state of the system at time \(t_{0}\) to the state
of the system at a later (or earlier) time, \(t\), via
\begin{equation}
  \ket{ \Psi \of{t} } = \op{U} \of{t-t_{0}} \ket{ \Psi \of{t_{0}} }
\end{equation}
Another simple case to consider is when the Hamiltonian varies but is piecewise
constant in time. In this case each constant segment has its own time evolution
operator, \(\op{U}_{i}\) and  the overall time evolution operator is just the
(appropriately ordered) product of these:
\begin{equation}
  \op{U} = \op{U}_{n} \cdot \op{U}_{n-1} \dots \op{U}_{2} \cdot \op{U}_{1}
\end{equation}
When the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, which it must be for a closed quantum system
(in order to conserve energy), the time evolution operator is unitary.

In the photonics applications discussed in this thesis,
the state space is discrete and finite, meaning that the wavefunction
can be expressed exactly as a complex vector of finite dimension and unit
magnitude. The number of
dimensions required is the number of optical modes, be they spatial,
polarisation or some other degree of freedom. The Hamiltonians that we consider
are piecewise constant in time (e.g. the application of a waveplate in bulk or
a directional coupler in integrated optics\footnote{between these optical
components, the Hamiltonian is diagonal with uniform elements.}) so the time
evolution operator is a natural description.

When considering Hamiltonians on a discrete (\(m\)-dimensional) space, for
example in the case of an \(m\) mode quantum walk \cite{walks-peruzzo}, the
matrix exponential in equation~\ref{eq:expiht} can be performed classically in
time polynomial in \(m\). This observation, along with the ability to realise
any unitary operator in linear optics (see section~\ref{sec:ReckScheme}), is the
basis of the quantum simulations performed in chapter~\ref{ch:Simulations}.

This model can be extended to consider non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, in which
case the same mathematics applies, but equation~\ref{eq:expiht} results in a 
non-unitary operator. Physically, we associate this with an open quantum system,
or a system coupled to some external degrees of freedom (an environment).
Chapter~\ref{ch:Simulations} also describes quantum simulations of this kind of
coupled system.

  beamsplitters and variable phase shifts are needed in order to make the
  circuit's operation reconfigurable to any unitary transformation. In the
  bulk scheme, I have omitted any specifics, but in the integrated version these
  could be implemented with directional couplers and thermal or electro-optic
  phase shifts \cite{peteschip}.}

\end{figure}
Any lossless\footnote{In practical devices, this approximation is very good.
(about 1dB/cm in silica devices)} linear optical device can be
described by a unitary matrix operating on the optical modes. A device with
\(m\) input and \(m\) output modes will be described by an \(m \by m\) unitary.
In~\cite{reck}, it is shown that the converse is true: any unitary matrix can
be realised by a linear optical circuit. A constructive proof of this is
presented, and an architecture for a `universal circuit' is proposed (see
figure~\ref{fig:ReckOriginal}). Universal in this context refers to a linear
optical circuit with adjustable components (beamsplitters with variable
reflectivity and variable phase shifts), which can be configured into any
unitary.

This result has profound consequences for experimental quantum photonics.
It implies that when such a circuit is built, \emph{all} other linear optical
devices will become redundant, being just specific configurations of the
general circuit. Rapid progress in fabrication and control of integrated optics
has recently brought a \(6 \by 6\) reconfigurable circuit to the lab
\cite{bigreck}, and some of the data in chapter~\ref{ch:Simulations} were taken
on this device.

\section{Boson Sampling}
\label{sec:BosonSampling}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{figures/bosonsampling}
  \caption[BosonSampling in linear optics]
  {(a) \bosonsampling{} in linear optics. \(p\) photons are injected into the
  first \(p\) inputs of an \(m\) mode linear optical circuit, then detected at
  the output, post-selecting on all photons occupying distinct modes. The
  probability of this event occurring depends on the description of the circuit,
  a unitary matrix \(\mat{U}\) (b). It can be calculated by taking columns of
  the unitary corresponding to the input modes (shaded red) and rows
  corresponding to the detector clicks (shaded green), the intersection of which
  defines a \(p \by p\) submatrix (c). The probability of the detection event is
  given by the absolute square of the permanent of this submatrix.}
  \label{fig:BosonSampling}
\end{figure}
This section presents a brief review of \bosonsampling{}: a sampling algorithm
presented by Aaronson and Arkhipov in~\cite{bosonsampling} (AA). None of
development or complexity analysis of this algorithm is my own work, but it
provides useful context for material in chapter~\ref{ch:DirectDialling} and
section~\ref{sec:RStar}.

In their development of the \bosonsampling{} problem, AA have described a
computational task that can be performed by a linear optical network which we
strongly believe cannot be performed efficiently by a classical computer. If we
find no
fundamental obstacle to demonstrating \bosonsampling{} in practice (or even
better, actually do it!), this would force us to abandon (or at least further
extend) the Extendend Church-Turing Thesis (ECT).

I will now briefly describe practical \bosonsampling{}, before returning to
consider the nature of this \emph{strong belief} on which the result is based
and how valuable it is as a computational model. As the name suggests, a
demonstration of \bosonsampling{} involves taking samples from a probability
distribution, in this case corresponding to the probabilities of detection
events in a linear optics experiment as shown in figure~\ref{fig:BosonSampling}.
The linear optics circuit on \(m\) modes is described by an \(m \by m\) unitary
matrix, \(\mat{U}\). We inject \(p\) photons into the first \(p\) input modes
and detect on all output modes. There are \(\comb{m+p-1}{p}\) possible output
configurations, of which \(\comb{m}{p}\) occupy the \emph{collision-free
subspace} i.e.\ where no mode contains more than one photon.

In order to calculate the probability of any detection event, we take the
indices of occupied input modes, \(\left\{ s_{0}, s_{1}, \dots, s_{p-1} \right\}
\) (usually assumed to be \(0, 1, \dots p-1\) without loss of generality) and
the indices of occupied output modes, \(\left\{ t_{0}, t_{1}, \dots, t_{p-1}
\right\}\). From the unitary \(\mat{U}\), we select rows corresponding to the
output modes and columns corresponding to the input modes, and take the
submatrix \(\mat{U}_{ST}\) defined by their intersections. The probability of
the event is the absolute square of the permanent of this submatrix, \(\abs{
\perm \of{ \mat{U}_{ST} }} \). This process is illustrated in
figure~\ref{fig:BosonSampling}.

This description gives us some intuition into why it may be hard to perform
\bosonsampling{} classically. The size of the distribution---\( \comb{m+p-1}{p}
\)---increases combinatorially with the number of photons\footnote{Provided that
the number of modes also increases accordingly}, so the memory requirement for
storing the entire distribution is not polynomial in \(p\). Further, even if one
didn't have to store the entire distribution to perform a sampling (and we
wouldn't expect to have to do this), just computing one element of it requires
evaluation of the permanent of a \(p \by p\) complex matrix. Computing
permanents exactly is \# P complete \cite{valiant} and the fastest known
algorithm (Ryser's algorithm) has running time \(\bigo \of{ p \cdot 2^{p} }\).
This is
by no means a proof that \bosonsampling{} is classically hard (if we inject
classical, distinguishable particles, we can sample the output distribution
without explicitly calculating \emph{any} \(p\)-particle probabilities), but it
does strongly suggest a link between \bosonsampling{} and the evaluation of
permanents or complex matrices.

The nature of the proof is that, if
the exact form of the \bosonsampling{} problem were performed classically, it
would imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. While this is not
expressly forbidden by complexity theory, the same can be said about the
conservation of energy and thermodynamics: the implications to a complexity
theorist are comparable in their absurdity. The caveat to this proof is that
even the quantum computer does not
perform \bosonsampling{} exactly, so this is an unfair demand to place on a
classical competitor. In the case of a reasonable approximate sampling, two
unproved
but plausible conjectures (backed up by numerical evidence) are required to
imply the same collapse of the polynomial hierarchy.

Against the better known challenger to the ECT, using Shor's algorithm to factor
large numbers, this actually compares very favourably. If somebody were to
announce tomorrow that they had developed a classical algorithm that could
factor numbers in polynomial time, the news would be very disruptive to
everyday life (and quantum computing research budgets) but it wouldn't have a
profound effect on complexity theory. A single decision problem (factoring)
would have to be moved from NP to P. We already know that factoring is not
NP-complete, so it wouldn't even have any implications on the long-standing
question of whether P=NP. If a classical Boson Sampler were unveiled, we would
have to revise the entire structure of the polynomial hierarchy (or revisit the
two conjectures in AA).

Now one may ask how this is considered a computation at all---after
all, it does not result in any deterministic outcome. A plausible
complaint might be that just because something cannot be modeled classically,
it doesn't make it a classically intractable computation. We can illustrate
this by pointing to a cow, and using it to define the \alg{Cow} algorithm.
After all, it is beyond the powers of our classical computers to model such a
large ensemble of atoms. Therefore does \alg{Cow} not disprove the
Church-Turing thesis?

The response requires us to look at the other feature of computations: the
input. We have no control over the input to \alg{Cow}, and even if we did it
would require a very large number of parameters (surely exponential in the size
of the cow?). On the other hand \bosonsampling{} is controlled by a small number
of input parameters (\(\bigo \of{m^{2}}\) for an \(m\) mode linear optical
circuit) and we have direct control over all of them.

A final important discussion surrounding \bosonsampling{} is that of
verification: if we have a large Boson Sampler, how can we confirm that it is
operating correctly? There is an important distinction to be made here between
a quantum algorithm like Shor factoring, which is in NP, and \bosonsampling{},
which is not. In the former case, the problem satisfies the \emph{short
certificate} property, guaranteeing that the output of any task in NP can be
verified in classical polynomial time. A valid certificate in the case of
factoring is the prime factors, since these can be efficiently multiplied
together to verify correct operation. Tasks outside NP have no such guarantee.
This difficulty was raised in the original proposal by Aaronson and Arkhipov,
and highlighted again by Gogolin et al \cite{gogolin}, who showed that under
certain circumstances it would be information-theoretically impossible to
distinguish the output of a Boson Sampler from that of a uniform sampling of the
configuration space. In chapter~\ref{ch:QCV} I describe methods to address this
problem, and gain some confidence in the correct operation of a \bosonsampling{}
device.
