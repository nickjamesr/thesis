\chapter{Calibration and Verificiation of Quantum Devices}
\label{ch:QCV}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:QCVIntro}
In this chapter, I describe the calibration and testing of a completely
reconfigurable circuit in bulk optics. By altering the parameters in this single
experiment, we were able to simulate the action of any lossless linear optics
circuit on four modes. The architecture was motivated by (but not identical to)
the scheme described by Reck et al in \cite{reck}. An application of this
circuit to quantum simulation is described in chapter~\ref{ch:Simulations}.

\section{Benchmarking (the first boson sampler)}
\label{sec:Benchmarking}
Note here that this kind of randomized benchmarking is not always particularly
useful.

\section{Verification}
\label{sec:Verification}
Work relating to verification in quantum walks and \bosonsampling{}. I don't
think it's unfair to say that I had the original motivation to implement the
\(\rstar\) protocol described in \cite{aaronson13}. I did the Bayesian model
comparison between \bosonsampling{} and uniform distributions.
