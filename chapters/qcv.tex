\chapter{Calibration and Verificiation of Quantum Devices}
\label{ch:QCV}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:QCVIntro}
In this chapter, I describe the two related tasks of \emph{calibration} and
\emph{verification} in the context of linear optical devices. The
quantum nature of the devices makes these problems more difficult than in the
classical case and worthy of detailed study.

I begin in section~\ref{sec:Calibration} by discussing the calibration of a
universal linear optical circuit, for example that described by Reck et al in
\cite{reck}. As a concrete example, I present detail of the calibration of the
circuit used for quantum simulations in chapter~\ref{ch:Simulations}.
Section~\ref{sec:Benchmarking} contains data showing randomised benchmarking of
this circuit to verify correct operation. This procedure is applicable to the
small scale circuit here, but cannot be applied in larger cases where the size
of the state space increases sharply with the system size.

Section~\ref{sec:Verification} addresses this problem of verification in large
systems. The analysis using the \(\rstar\) discriminator (as described
in~\cite{notuniform}) and the discussion of \emph{Bosonic clouding} appeared in
a Nature Photonics article \cite{verification}.

\section{Benchmarking (the first boson sampler)}
\label{sec:Benchmarking}
Note here that this kind of randomized benchmarking is not always particularly
useful.

\section{Verification}
\label{sec:Verification}
Work relating to verification in quantum walks and \bosonsampling{}. I don't
think it's unfair to say that I had the original motivation to implement the
\(\rstar\) protocol described in \cite{notuniform}. I did the Bayesian model
comparison between \bosonsampling{} and uniform distributions.

Verifying the output of a Boson sampler brings us up against the notorious
problem of certifying a random number generator based on a short string of
random output. This problem is illustrated in figure:~\ref{fig:dilbert}

\subsection{Is BosonSampling uniform?}

  data from a 3-photon experiment in a 9-mode unitary is shown as a histogram.
  (b) Bayesian model comparison allows real-time updating of our confidence in
  the model describing our data. The models under comparison here are true
  \bosonsampling{} (blue) and uniform sampling (black). We rapidly conclude that
  the data are supported much better by the \bosonsampling{} model.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bosonic Clouding}
\label{sec:Clouding}
In a multi-photon quantum walk, we observe a phenomenon where photons tend to
appear in nearby output modes. This is distinct from \emph{Bosonic bunching},
where multiple photons appear in the same output mode.

\subsection{Higher photon numbers}
\label{sec:SixPhoton}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/sixphoton}
  \caption[Bayesian model comparison on 6-photon events]
  {Bayesian model comparison using the full pre-calculated 6-photon
  distributions. (a) Events we believe to be quantum. (b) Events we believe to
  be classical. In both cases, our confidence in the model quickly increases.}
  \label{fig:sixphoton}
\end{figure}
I did some verification on 6-photon events in the recent integrated Reck
experiment. With the circuit set to implement the 6-dimensional quantum Fourier
transform, we injected 6 photons in the state \(\ket{3_{1},3_{2}}\) and
performed a Bayesian model comparison between the quantum and classical
distributions. Again, we quickly become very confident that the data are
quantum, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:sixphoton}.

It's worth mentioning somehow that the quantum interference here is in some way
not `true' 6-photon quantum interference. It seems to come out as equivalent to
around 3 photons, but I can't remember quite how Chris and I came up with that
figure.

The photons are injected into just two input modes. In order to obtain classical
results, it is sufficient to introduce a time delay between these two modes,
without applying relative delays between the three photons in the same mode.
This is readily derived by considering the probabilities of output events in
terms of matrix permanents.
