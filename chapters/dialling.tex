\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:DDIntro}
This chapter serves as a good introduction to some of the important concepts
that will crop up later on. I will begin with an introduction to the Reck
scheme \cite{reck94}, an architecture for realising any unitary matrix in linear
optics; then proceed to explain \bosonsampling \cite{bosonsampling}, a task that
may enable a demonstration of computational superiority of linear optics over
classical computers. The main results of the chapter concerns the important task
of dialling Haar random unitary matrices into a linear-optical Reck scheme. This
is achieved by way of a coordinate transformation parameterising unitaries in
terms of physical parameters. The final section is a further application of this
parameterisation to the task of inferring the unitary description of a linear
optical circuit.

\section{A universal circuit for linear optics}
\label{sec:ReckScheme}
Any lossless\footnote{In practical devices, this approximation is very good.
What is the loss in dB/cm for our Reck scheme?} linear optical device can be
described by a unitary matrix operating on the optical modes. A device with
\(m\) input and \(m\) output modes will be described by an \(m \by m\) unitary.
In~\cite{reck94}, it is shown that the converse is true: any unitary matrix can
be realised by a linear optical circuit. A constructive proof of this is
presented, and a candidate `universal circuit' is proposed. Universal, in this
context refers to a linear optical circuit with adjustable components
(beamsplitters with variable reflectivity and variable phase shifts), which can
be configured into any unitary.

  performs a unitary transformation on the modes. Variable-reflectivity
  beamsplitters and variable phase shifts are needed in order to make the
  circuit's operation reconfigurable to any unitary transformation. In the
  bulk scheme, I have omitted any specifics, but in the integrated version these
  could be implemented with directional couplers and thermal or electro-optic
  phase shifts \todo{citation needed}.}

\section{Unitary Inference}
\label{sec:UnitaryInference}
One of the most important tasks in practical quantum computing is that of
tomography: what does the device in the lab actually do? Although general
methods exist \todo{citation needed}, they are intractable, requiring a number
of measurements that scales exponentially in system size.
