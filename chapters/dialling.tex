\section{Introduction}
Early theoretical work that I did. Motivated by the question: if we want a Haar
unitary from a Reck scheme\cite{reck94}, can we just set the parameters
(reflectivities and phase shifts) randomly and independenly? If so, what
distributions? Answer: yes and a load of beta distributions, depending on where
the beamsplitter is.

\section{Arithmetic of probability density functions}
I spent a lot of time considering these. I think I can present this as
preliminary material.

\section{The Reck scheme}
More background. Essential for several sections/chapters.

\section{Results: the distributions}
Explicitly lay out what probability distributions are required.

\section{Proof}
In terms of a coordinate transformation

\section{Applications}
Most obviously, generating Haar unitaries (or truncations thereof) directly in
experimental parameters

Further work: reconstructing a unitary using Bayesian inference on this
parameterisation.
