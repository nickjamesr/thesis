\section{Introduction}
Work relating to verification in quantum walks and \bosonsampling. I don't think
it's unfair to say that I had the original motivation to implement the
\(\rstar\) protocol described in \cite{aaronson13}. I did the Bayesian model
comparison between \bosonsampling and uniform distributions.
