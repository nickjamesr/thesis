\chapter{The Last Bulk Optics Experiment}
\label{ch:BulkCircuit}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, I describe the calibration and testing of a completely
reconfigurable circuit in bulk optics. By altering the parameters in this single
experiment, we were able to simulate the action of any lossless linear optics
circuit on four modes. The architecture was motivated by (but not identical to)
the scheme described by Reck et al in \cite{reck94}. An application of this
circuit to quantum simulation is described in chapter~\ref{ch:Simulations}.
