\begin{quote}
  ``Please correct the places where `distance' is used incorrectly.''
\end{quote}
The paragraph defining the fidelity has been rewritten as follows:
\begin{quote}
  ``To evaluate the fidelity of our simulations, we look at two quantities. The
  first is computed from the trace of the product of the unitary matrix that we
  intended to implement, and the matrix that we in fact did implement, according
  to the data we collect. If the desired unitary is \(\mat{U}\) and
  the measured unitary is \(\mat{U^{\prime}}\), this fidelity,
  \(F_{\mathrm{tr}}\) is defined by:
  \begin{equation}
    F_{\mathrm{tr}}=\frac{1}{2}\abs{\Tr\of{\mat{U}^{\dagger}{\mat{U}^{\prime}}}}
  \end{equation}
  In the case of perfect implementation, \(\mat{U}\) and \(\mat{U^{\prime}}\)
  will be the same (and both unitary), yielding unit fidelity; an imperfect
  implementation results in a fidelity less than one.''
\end{quote}
Previously incorrect uses of `distance' throughout the document now reference
these `fidelities' and make no claim to be a `distance'.

\section{}
\begin{quote}
  ``Please consider the relative impact of changes in mode index vs
  mode coupling as a function of wavelength on p100 and provide a
  revised paragraph.''
\end{quote}

\section{}
\begin{quote}
  ``Please give an explicit description of how the parametrisation of
  Haar random unitaries given in the thesis produces the correct
  distribution of elements of the first column of the unitary in the 3x3
  case.  Please also use the parametrisation in the 3x3 case to produce
  a number of random unitaries and confirm that they are correctly
  distributed [using some appropriate measure of your choice].''
\end{quote}

\section{}
\begin{quote}
  ``Please update the Appendix to correctly list the preprints as
  referred to elsewhere in the thesis.''
\end{quote}
I have inserted the following text into the appendix, after the list of
first-author preprints:
\begin{quote}
  ``I am co-author on one additional preprint
  \begin{itemize}
    \item E. Mart\'in L\'opez, N. J. Russell, C. Sparrow, J. L. O'Brien and A.
      Laing, ``Quantum simulation of phonons in the harmonic limit'',
      \textit{in preparation}.''
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\section{}
\begin{quote}
  ``Please either produce a revised Figure 4.6 or find another way to
  make sure that this is correctly described''
\end{quote}
Figure 4.6 has been revised to show the correct axis labels. The new version
(figure \ref{fig:manifolds}) is reproduced here.
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics{manifolds}
  \caption{Revised version of figure 4.6, with the axes correctly labelled.}

\section{}
\subsection*{Other minor edits made}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add number to the three equations formerly missing them.
  \item Assign different symbols to the figures of merit in section 4.3.2.
  \item Correct other minor typographical errors (e.g. spelling and
        punctuation).
\end{enumerate}
