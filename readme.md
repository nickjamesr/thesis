# The First Linear Optical Quantum Computers
## My PhD thesis (working title)

A work in progress, though I am aiming to have a first draft by mid-April and be
submitting not long after that.

List of chapters:

## Background
The usual introductory matter

## Direct Dialling
How do we obtain Haar unitaries in an experimental setting?

## Boson Simulations
Photons are Bosons so can simulate other Bosons.

## Calibration, Verification and Validation
Due to the nature of quantum computing, these tasks are more difficult than they
would be classically.

## Tomography of Hamiltonians
A neat procedure to determine the Hamiltonian underlying a process with simple
measurements. Experimentally demonstrated in a photonic quantum walk.
