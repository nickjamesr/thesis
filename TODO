Data that needs gathering:
  - Evidence that I'm well out of the optimum for Hamiltomo

Figures that still need figuring out:
  - Deduction of time parameter for QW at different wavelengths (Hamiltomo)

Background that needs writing:
  - SST
  - BosonSampling

Discussion that needs writing:
  - Vibrational states/molecules
  - Tichy verification (ZTL)
  - Hamiltomo results - why are they crap?

Organisation to be done:
  - Move experimental details for simulation chapter out of PT symmetry and into
    separate section
  - Add experimental details section in other experimental chapters
