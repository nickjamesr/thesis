Data that needs gathering:
  - fidelities for 3 site model

Figures that still need figuring out:
  - Deduction of time parameter for QW at different wavelengths (Hamiltomo)
  - Why is the 0,1 (PT) data from the chip so dodgy?

Background that needs writing:
  - Experimental details (for all sections)
  - Description of chip setup for Simulations

Discussion that needs writing:
  - Hamiltomo results - why are they crap?

Organisation to be done:
