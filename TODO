Data that needs gathering:
  - Chip data for PT symmetry
  - Evidence that I'm well out of the optimum for Hamiltomo

Figures that still need figuring out:
  - Deduction of time parameter for QW at different wavelengths (Hamiltomo)

Background that needs writing:
  - SST
  - Experimental details

Discussion that needs writing:
  - Vibrational states/molecules
  - Tichy verification (ZTL)
  - Hamiltomo results - why are they crap?

Organisation to be done:
