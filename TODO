Data that needs gathering:
  - Experimental clouding
  - Evidence that I'm well out of the optimum for Hamiltomo

Figures that still need figuring out:
  - Big clouds

Background that needs writing:
  - SST

Discussion that needs writing:
  - Vibrational states/molecules
  - Tichy verification (ZTL)
  - Hamiltomo results - why are they crap?
