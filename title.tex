\begin{acknowledgements}
  The Centre for Quantum Photonics for Bristol has provided the environment in
  which it was possible for me to complete my PhD research. This environment
  includes the provision of office and lab space, but more importantly, the
  people to guide and advise me, bounce ideas off, and help me through the more
  difficult times. The research group has grown an incredible amount since I
  started my PhD and I can't thank everyone by name, but I would like to make
  special note of some people, inside the CQP and out.
