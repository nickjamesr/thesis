Power meter measurements for 774,776,778nm

Each file is numbered (e.g. 6_11.csv) with the range of outputs that had a
detector.

Each line refers to a single input mode

There are 3 lists (comma separated) on each line, which are the three
wavelengths in order 774, 776, 778

Within each list, the elements correspond to an output

e.g. in 6_11.csv:

line 1: input in mode 1 (indexing from 1)
774:{P6,P7,P8,P9,P10,P11}, 776:{P6,P7,P8,P9,P10,P11}, 778:{P6,P7,P8,P9,P10,P11}
