My PhD thesis, not yet started, as even my preliminary deadline is not until
January 2015.

It's going to be public at some point, so I see no problem with keeping it on a
public github repo. If you learn something new, like something, feel like you
you have something to add, etc. please get in touch. I'd rather collaborate on
further work than compete.
